// – Generate an alert if that same file (i.e. hash) has been uploaded
// before stating “This note has already been uploaded”
// • If the note has not been uploaded before:
// – Upload the note to IPFS and display the IPFS hash (you can also
// console.log the hash in the terminal as well)
// • In a list, display:
// – The name of the note
// – The hash of the note on IPFS
// • For every note in the list, the hash should be clickable and should open
// an IPFS gateway link to that given note.
// • If there are no notes display the text “No notes have been uploaded yet”
